## [Planner-App](https://nakul-bounty-planner-app.netlify.app/)

I have added the calculator widget as a custom widget that provides users with a convenient way to perform calculations and mathematical operations within the planner app.

### Reasons for Choosing the Calculator Widget:

- Enhanced Productivity: By integrating a calculator within the planner app, users can conveniently perform calculations within the app. It saves time and effort, enabling users to stay focused and productive within the app.

- User Convenience: By using a calculator widget, users can perform calculations on-the-go, without the need to switch to other tools or devices.

### How to use the calculator widget:

- If a user needs to do numerical calculations such as time management, or scheduling then he/she can locate the calculator widget within the app's interface. And the calculator will be displayed as a separate component.

- To input a calculation, click or tap on the calculator buttons representing the desired numbers and operators. And voilà! the calculator will do the calculations for you.

-  You can also choose the location your component by choosing the option the top left of the widget.
