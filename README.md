## [Planner-App](https://nakul-bounty-planner-app.netlify.app/)
I have added the calculator widget as a custom widget that provides users with a convenient way to perform calculations and mathematical operations within the planner app.
### Reasons for Choosing the Calculator Widget:
- Enhanced Productivity: By integrating a calculator within the planner app, users can conveniently perform calculations within the app. It saves time and effort, enabling users to stay focused and productive within the app.
- User Convenience: By using a calculator widget, users can perform calculations on-the-go without the need to switch to other tools or devices.
### How to use the calculator widget:
- If a user needs to do numerical calculations such as time management or scheduling, he or she can locate the calculator widget within the app's interface. And the calculator will be displayed as a separate component.
- To input a calculation, click or tap on the calculator buttons representing the desired numbers and operators. And voilà! the calculator will do the calculations for you.
-  You can also choose the location of your component by choosing the option at the top left of the widget.
